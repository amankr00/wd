    <h3>1. HTML </h3>
    <p> It is the very basic language to create website. 
        It gives the structure of the site . Previously , websites were very static and less interactive and reliable. As HTML can only help us with the basic structure of a site . It was CSS that makes the site look attractice and beautiful. Javascript makes ther site dynamic and reliable and robust .

    <h3>3. JAVASCRIPT </h3>
    <p> After HTML and CSS . We managed to make a beautiful and an attractive website which can be scaled in large numbers. But we now had the challenge of handeling millions of requests per second coming to the server. By the use of Javascript we can do various other functions which can be handled by the website on its own . By this technology we get reliabilty in websites. Now ,  we can happily and smpoothly surf through millions of sites available on the web .
